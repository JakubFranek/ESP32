# ESP32

This is a playground repository for my ESP32 experiments, as most of these experiments are rather small and/or banal and there is no need to create a separate repository for them.

The code tested in these test projects tends to end up in a "proper" project, such as [Home Air Monitoring System](https://github.com/JakubFranek/Home-Air-Monitoring-System/tree/master).
